This repository holds all data and code used as part of the EcoLunch chat titled "Cleaning data with R" at the University of Nevada, Reno which took place in 02/16/2024. 
The structure of the repository is as follows:
* The files `ecolunch_vignette.Rmd` and `ecolunch_vignette.html` contain a vignette with a walkthrough example of all the functions disucussed during the EcoLunch. 
* The folder `data` contains:
  * The script `generate_mock_datasets.R`, which has code to generate the `forest_data.RData` and `lake_data.RData` datasets.
  * The `forest_data.RData` data set, a simulated dataset containing information on the tree height over a 100 year sequence (rows) for 5 different forests (columns).
  * The `lake_data.RData` data set, a simulated dataset containing information on the nitrogen and chlorine concentrations of 3 lakes over 100 days.
  * The `lizards.RData` data set, an example of a real-world data set obtained in a mark-recapture study of lizards.
